## Running the Application
To run the code: clone the repository to your local machine, then open the "OpenFishR.Rmd" file in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and click "Run Document" (you will also have to install any missing packages before it will work correctly). To see remote images correctly you will need to view the OpenFishR.Rmd output in a browser.

Enjoy!
